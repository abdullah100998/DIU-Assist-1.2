#### Project Type :
Our project is a graphical user interface project. This is actually a project of Java FX and Java Swing. This project is basically a desktop application. Through this, the user will be able to create the software the way he wants, which means that this software will actually play an important role in saving time. In this project, a Daffodil student is going to work with everything he/she uses in his daily life, from the student portal to the BLC as well as from the account office and faculty site.

#### Description :
Basically our software will handle the all basic work of a computer science student. where all the teachers and students info will be given, all social and important link also. There is also a login option for user, in this software it have its own browser which will make comfort for user.



#### Requirement Specification :                                         
•	This software is made with a use case diagram.
•	Daffodil CSE student is going to work with everything he/she uses in his daily life.
•	Login-logout by mail for students.
•	It can use only by downloading and installing the software.
•	This app must have a graphical user interface that's will make it more user-friendly.
•	This is our software apps or the way you go here, you can go to the link from there.
•	The main thing is of this software is to helps students have, sometimes they have to go to many places many times. Here all their links of the varsity will be combined in        this app and the user will be made dependent.
•	This app has Database for storing Students/Teachers Information.
•	It has a MySQL Database operation for saving/remove information.
•	Mainly focused on memory management for any low configure computer it can support.

#### Literature Review : 
In our project Literature Review includes whether any such application was created before us. Even before us, an app was created which is known as DI U Smart App in the Play Store. We are working in a very special way with time, so that in a very short time the user can move from one place to another as he needs. His time complexity should be reduced. He should be able to access everything on the bus without installing anything in a very short time.

The outcome of this project will be a GUI application all people can use to get & set information . This will also be able to use for browse necessry sites. 

#### Conclusion:
This was a great experience doing this project. This project was intended to make the DIU system easier and reliable. I hope the intention of the program gets full filled.. The challenges we faced and the learning we have gone through will come in great help in the future.
